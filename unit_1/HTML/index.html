		<h1>Dress Yourself</h1>

		<p>This is a website designed so that you can style yourself</p>

		<a href="http://scapewallpaper.com/walkin-closet-balcony/">

		<p>This is a site that I've just recently thought of creating. I love clothes and fashions and dressing in different styles; sometimes it gets bothersome trying on and taking off different articles of clot\hing when inventing new outfits. Thats when i thought what better idea than to dress yourself virtually.</p>

		<ul>virtual walkin closet, 3d model of yourself, ability to upload clothing, makeup and hairstyle upload</ul>
